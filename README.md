# ANN_Churn_data

This porject aims to tune an Artificial Neural Network on a bank's dataset to predict customer churn.The data set is in the form of a csv file with about 10000 rows. 

* The data set containes variables like the credit score, weather the customer has a credit card,is an active member etc.

* Keras has been used to build the Neural Network

* Two hidden layers have been used 

* The hidden layers used the rectifier activation fucntion and the outer layer uses the sigmoid activation function.

* Gridsearch has been used to find the optimal combination of parametets. 

* Due to the computation time the dataset has been trained but not fitted on the test dataset
